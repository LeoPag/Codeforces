# Codeforces
This repo contains my C++ solutions to the competitive programming problems on the website Codeforces. The idea is to build up problem solving skills and to strengthen algorithmic thinking. Both contests and practice problems are shared in this repo. Each folder contains the code solution to the problems. The problem description can be found on the website.
